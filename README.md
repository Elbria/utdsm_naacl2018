# Cross-topic distributional semantic representations via unsupervised mappings

This is the code for our NAACL2018 submission. The code implements the models described in the two following papers:

* [Topic-based Distributional Semantic Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8334459/)
>Fenia Christopoulou, Eleftheria Briakou, Elias Iosif, Alexandros Potamianos

* [Cross-topic distributional semantic representations via unsupervised mappings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05674.pdf)
>Eleftheria Briakou, Nikos Athanasiou, Alexandros Potamianos

## Setup

Create virtual environment and run the main script from the project directory:

* ```$ python3 -m venv utdsm_venv```

* ``bash main.sh``

## Data

The code expects two-versions of _pre-processed_ data:

* sentence-level

* document-level

``Note: Toy corpora are also provided under data/``
